        The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language
        for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be
        assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and

            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of
            the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other
            technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web
            page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior
            (JavaScript).

            Node. js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers,
            due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web
            sites and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time,
            push-based architectures in mind.

            LNodemailer is a module for Node. js applications to allow easy as
            cake email sending. The project got started back in 2010 when there
            was no sane option to send email messages, today it is the solution
            most Node. js users turn to by default.
